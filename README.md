# Week-9-Ensembled-Techniques
From the UCI Repository, I picked up a couple of datasets where I performed basic EDA including
treatment of outliers using Z-Score.
Following this I checked the count of target variable for classification problems and performed
oversampling using SMOTE so as to ensure there is no bias.
The next I did is created different Ensemble models and also checking the accuracy in test set.
The model which gave the best accuracy in test set, I searched the hyper parameters using RandomSearchCV
Finally I performed Bootstrap Sampling and calculated the 95% confidence interval for the models.
